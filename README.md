# Check SEO Bash Script

Simple terminal script to print out file names, titles, descriptions, alt tags and unneeded sources files (Adobe proprietary formats, TIFF, EPS, etc) from a web site directory.

The exported file name is "seo.txt".

Useful to quickly verify the presence of basic search engine optimization info in HTML files; and reduce web site clutter.
